## Overview
**Dead End** is a time-based survival horror maze game where players must navigate through a dark and unsettling maze within a strict three-minute time limit. The goal is to find the exit before time runs out while avoiding a terrifying monster that awakens after one minute.

The monster starts slow, moving at half the player’s speed, but after two minutes, it enters Rage Mode, doubling its speed and tripling its attack damage. If the monster fails to catch the player by the end of three minutes, the game restarts.

Power-ups such as speed and health boosts are scattered throughout the maze, providing strategic opportunities to outmaneuver the creature. Every decision matters in this high-stakes, adrenaline-fueled escape.
